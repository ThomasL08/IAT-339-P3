    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
    <p>
      While designing and coding the website, I encountered various coding-related issues, mainly due to my abilities
      needing to match my designs, making it more challenging to work on.

    </p>
    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      The solution was to look up parts of CSS effects I had trouble with and look online for help. Like most coding
      projects
      looking online is the best way to learn and overcome any coding-related issues or complications. Furthermore,
      using the built-in vs code terminal in conjunction with HTML/CSS validator help to further find bugs within the
      code.

    </p>
    <h2>My Takeaways:</h2>
    <p>
      Learning the way to google and ask certain questions is helpful in actually finding related resources this project as this
      was before the era of chatGPT. Also, not giving up and work through the problems is the only way to get good at
      programming.

    <h2>Conclusion / Result</h2>
    <p>
      Overall this project was a success. I learned a lot of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and hover effects; it helped me
      understand my skill level and allowed me to focus on the things I still need to work on.
