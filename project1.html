			<p>Designing and creating a fictional architecture museum website is an exciting academic project that
				involves several steps. The first step in the process is to research and gather information about
				architecture museums and their websites. This includes studying the content, layout, and design of
				existing websites to gain inspiration and ideas. Where Unit London was very influential in our design
				decisions.After deciding on the pages that will be included on the website, such as a home page, an
				about page, an exhibitions page, and Artist page, and a contact page were decided I was takes with
				creating the conented for each of the pages this included the images and text for each of the pages.</p>

			<p>Next we had split up the work as this was a team project I was given the task of programming most of
				the pages since I had more expereice with html css and Javascript. Due to the short deadline of this
				project and the limiation of my team members knowledge on html and css we decided that the best course
				of action is to simpfiy the website specifically the content image. In this case all the content below
				the main landing / hero page is just a image created by me on Figma</p>
