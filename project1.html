        <h2>Project Details:</h2>
        <p>Course: IAT 235</p>
        <h2>Project Duration:</h2>
        <p>1.5 week</p>

        <h2>Project Objective / Goals</h2>
        <p>
            The objective is to create a functional website for a museum related to project two, which was architect
            designers, which will need to include a landing page, exhibition/ events page, artist page, and two detailed
            exhibitions by those architectural designers.

        <h2>Research:</h2>
        <p>
            We had looked at many museum websites paying attention to the layout. We found many unique structures, some
            more abstract with expressive typography as the main driving force behind the layout and design, while
            others with more standard configurations. Due to the short time constraints of the projects and the
            inexperience of my group member concerning HTML and CSS, we had to lower our expectations. After stumbling
            upon Unit London museum website, the 2021 version, we found various elements that become the main components
            of your design.

        <h2>My Role:</h2>
        <p> I design and collect images for website content
            Coding the web pages such as the landing page, the artist page, the event/ exhibition page, and the two
            detailed exhibition pages.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges:</h2>
        <p>There were many coding challenges throughout the development of the project. Initially, we decided to split
            the coding between us since this was a group project to decrease the production time and meet the short
            deadline. However, we encountered code issues not complying correctly and not displaying the correct layout
            we were trying to create. Furthermore, we had to design the web page of the two detailed exhibition pages
            due to time and our coding styles being quite different. It took time to debug the code, which resulted in
            me having to recode most of the code written by my team member as I was more knowledgeable in HTML and CSS
            than he was. In hindsight, we should have created a cohesive style guide, and coding rules to follow would
            have significantly reduced the issues that arose.

        </p>
        <h2>My Takeaways:</h2>
        <p>Setting up Coding rules
            Having a style guide is vital in maintaining the layout and design of the website accurately.
            </p>
        <h2>Conclusion / Result</h2>
        <p>Despite the setbacks and time constraints, we got a high B for the project, and I gained more knowledge on
            project management and expanded my expertise in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
