    <h2>Research:</h2>
    <p>
      We had looked at many museum websites paying attention to the layout. We found many unique structures, some
      more abstract with expressive typography as the main driving force behind the layout and design, while
      others with more standard configurations. Due to the short time constraints of the projects and the
      inexperience of my group member concerning HTML and CSS, we had to lower our expectations. After stumbling
      upon Unit London museum website, the 2021 version, as seen in figure 1 we found various elements that become the
      main components
      of our design.
